WhatsNew file for Zip 2.32

(See Changes for details)

New things in Zip 2.32

- Fixed -R operation to match the supplied file patterns in all recursed
  subdirectories, like PKZIP 2.04 "-p -r" (or PKZIPC 4+ "-recurse")
- Handle cases where -x, -R, and -i patterns are mixed
- Fixes to ZipSplit, ZipNotes, and ZipCloak
- Example C-Sharp code added for using zip32.dll (thanks to Adrian Maull)
- Implemented some directory search speedups
- Windows NTFS time fix
- Fix VMS logical name parse problem
- Handle VMS [...]
- Add VMS DEBUG option
- Fixed bug when encrypting large uncompressable files
- Updated VMS help
- Fixed selecting files to delete by date bug
- Add new option, -MM, that will force Zip to exit with an OPEN error
  (usually error code 18) as soon as it finds an input pattern that
  is not matched during the directory scan or an input file that is
  unreadable or locked when Zip tries to open it, and without creating
  an archive (Note that, without -MM, Zip will do the usual thing of
  warning when a pattern is not matched and skipping files it can't
  read, creating the archive with what it can read, then exiting with
  an OPEN error if files were skipped)
- Add check for when zip tries to exceed the limit for seeking in
  the output file and exit with error, instead of creating a
  possibly bad archive
- Can now handle Unix FIFO (named pipes)
- Minor changes to allow Zip to compile with Visual C++ 2005

New things in Zip 2.31

- Crypt now part of source distribution (see Readme.cr)
- Bug fixes:
  - Debian patch 001 - Converted quoted strings
  - Debian patch 002 - Makefile changes
  - Debian patch 003 - Build changes

- Split VMS -V into -V and -VV (see Manual)
- New VC6 project files thanks to Cosmin

- Add api.c kluge for zip32.dll to support Visual Basic
- Binary detection changed from 20% binary to new algorithm
  that should better detect word processing files as binary
  and should accept UTF-8 files as text.  This flags the file
  in the archive as TEXT or BINARY for use by UnZip for line
  end conversion (see proginfo/txtvsbin.txt)
